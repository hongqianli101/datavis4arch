ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND THE COST OF HUMAN LIVES
By Mengyao Chen, Swezya Joshi, Hongqian Li

This data visualization project focuses on the issue of missing and deceased immigrants across the American continent. Initiated with a series of interviews with immigrants and reinforced with datasets from Missing Migrants Project by International Organization for Migration (IOM), our work aims to provide a clear and impactful representation of their journeys.

By visualizing the routes taken, the causes of death, and the locations where these tragedies occurred, we hope to offer a deeper understanding of the immigrants' experiences, bring to life the stories of those who embarked on these perilous journeys, and seek to elevate public awareness and stimulate discussion around this critical issue.

Our goal is to foster a sense of empathy and urgency, encouraging actions that address and mitigate these tragic losses.
